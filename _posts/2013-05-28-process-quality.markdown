  I stumbled across this video about The Art of Quality. The art of quality comes
  down to process and I have to admit my process is pretty chaotic. I think sometimes
  I don't get the results I'm looking for or I have this ongoing thought that my work
  could always be better. The major takeaway from this lecture is if you want to produce
  quality work have a process that focuses on quality and NEVER take shortcuts. Do
  everything in the process!"
