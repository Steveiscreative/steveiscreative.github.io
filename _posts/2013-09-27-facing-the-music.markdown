<p>Yesterday, I posted about getting rid of Facebook and today, I would like to talk about a realization I just had. I can't do everything. Well...by myself at least.</p>
<p>I have so many goals and aspirations and the problem I've been facing is going after ALL  of them simultaneously, by myself. It's been pretty tough and I've been going crazy. I need people and I need help. I just had to face the music.</p>
