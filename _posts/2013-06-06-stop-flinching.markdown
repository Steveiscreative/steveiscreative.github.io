<p>A while back I was listening to the <a href="http://www.accidentalcreative.com/podcasts/ac/ac-podcast-julien-smith-on-the-flinch/">Accidental Creative</a> podcast with Julien Smith as the special guess. Julien had mentioned his book "<em>The Flinch</em>" co-authored by Seth Godin and yesterday I finally got around to reading some of it. It's an interesting book and I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has been using fear to stop them to achieve greatness.</p>
<p>So what is the flinch? So what I've put together so far, the flinch is the survival method we've used for centuries in the presence of danger. It's basically the flight wiring in our brain telling us to run like the wind. The issue is "the flinch", was originally intended for REAL life or death situations, like encountering a lion. Hmmm...lol..<a href="http://pixelbark.com/5303/louis-ck-on-human-evolution-and-lions">lions</a>. In today's society, we really aren't in as much danger as we think we are and the flinch mechanism were genetically predisposed to is being encountered facing less serious events. Like asking someone out or starting a business. Things that you wouldn't die from if you just did them.</p>
<p>My take away so far is stop flinching for these non life-threatening events and just do them. Save your flinching for the birds...or bears.</p>
<p>Read the book. It's free. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Flinch-ebook/dp/B0062Q7S3S">http://www.amazon.com/The-Flinch-ebook/dp/B0062Q7S3S</a></p>
