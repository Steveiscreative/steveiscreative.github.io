<p>Yesterday started a new month and I wanted to start something new by announcing my goals for the month online. I usually have my goals written down some where but they get lost, or I forget so I've decided to put them up on something I plan on using often and check on a daily basis, my website. I started the month reading<strong>Â <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1477800670/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1477800670&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=stevestephcre-20">Manage Your Day-to-Day: Build Your Routine, Find Your Focus, and Sharpen Your Creative Mind</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=stevestephcre-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1477800670" width="1" height="1" border="0" /> </strong> and I have to admit I'm pretty amped up. I'll talk about the book in a later post. So... goals for June.</p>
