This year has been something. I've experienced pretty much every emotion possible. I've had to attend a couple of funerals of people I care for a lot :*(, got married, and bought a house (to name a few things). 2015 has been real but with the gamut of emotions I've experienced so far, I honestly can't wait till it's over. I can say with all I've experienced this year, I have grown and learned about myself... I guess that's life.

Anyhow...
I really feel shitty for abandoning my site/blog, so I promise to do better with posting things on here and writing more in general (which always ends up being my new years resolution). So with that said, I've delete all of my old post and wanted to start fresh on my content. I really don't care for SEO (for this site, not in general) and I don't think my content was worth bookmarking, so... I don't think any ones feed or life would be ruined because of my actions.

 I can't make any promises but I'll be trying to post something every weekday, but again, no promises. More than likely, I'll have to work my way up to that. But I can promise you that I'll be posting at least once a week. Mainly on things I'm learning about, books I'm reading and what ever is on my mind. So, stay tuned folks!
