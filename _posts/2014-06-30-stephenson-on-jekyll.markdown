About... two days ago I had cursed WordPress to hell and decided to move on to a new platform. Well not really, but I did decide to drop WordPress as my blogging platform and to explore the terrain. At first I thought I was going to go off and explore many options. But honestly, I looked into Jekyll, saw what others had to say, joined the "only use a database when necessary movement" (I'll touch on why in another post), and started to build my site in Jekyll. 

To digress a little, since databases are on my mind now. The one thing I hate about WordPress is the database. It's not really built with performance in mind. That's why WordPress sites tend to fold when they reach 500-1000 pages/post, etc. I've had bad experiences with WordPress concerning the database. I'm not bitter. I think WordPress 4.0 comes out in another month or so, I'd really like an overhaul in the database structure. It's not likely due to legacy data but it would be nice. I'll post a 'proposal' of a new database design as a pet project. See if I can do better. If I can't then I'll shutup about this.

Anyhow. Where was I... Jeykll. Getting up and running didn't take much. I was able to complete this in a couple of days, probably, 5 hours total if I had to give an estimate and most of the time I was screwing around. I think the toughest part was to import my existing content from WordPress but it was due to gem dependencies. Even though my site isn't complete I wanted to launch my new blog and 'design live'. For the next couple of days I'll be designing the rest of the site. Mainly polishing up the design and adding an about, work and art page.

In the last post, I felt like I gave a shallow reason of why I was [abondoning wordpress][abwp]. To elaborate on my reasoning, one of the things that was bothering me about my old site was that it was slow. The initial page load was between 4-8s and this was with caching enabled. I'm not attributing the speed issues solely on WordPress but I know that it's one of the factors in this complex equation. Another factor could be the fact that I'm on a shared server. Which always can have it's issues. In terms of my boredom, I've been developing in WordPress since 2009 and it's been great. I still develop with WordPress at my job, for clients and I've even started a company selling WordPress themes. And this is where my boredom has spawned from. 

Well, stay tuned. I'm just getting started.
