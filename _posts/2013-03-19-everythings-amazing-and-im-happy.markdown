<p>This evening, I stumbled across a video of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=Al5RhaJgxxU#!">man with a robotic arm</a> doing some everyday things. I said to myself  "WOW, that's f*cking awesome!" It reminded me of the a show I was watching the other day called "Make Me Superhuman". The show was about how teams and individuals around the world are using robotics to enhances and/or expand the humans physical potential.  I started to think of how far we've come as a species in such a short period of time. It's amazing that we're living in this time period where it seems that the sky is the limit. Where people and teams are building incredible things for the greater good of humanity. Inventing machines that are helping people walk... or see for the first time — ever. We are in a time where we have access to some of the greatest minds the past and present with a click of a button. I feel honored to live in such a time period where we as people are sort of collectively and collaboratively building a digital archive of all the amazing things we've done and are doing right this very second. We for the most part, there is a lot of useless stuff out there. Louis CK had once said that "Everything's amazing and Nobody's Happy" and I can't help to agree with him. People hastily complain about some of the smallest things and not witness the small everyday wonder that is happening before their eyes. I'm an optimist by nature so it's always been easy for me to find the good in everything but I  firmly believe that the human species is truly amazing because everyday I've waken up I've been able to see some of the most amazing things made by human. We're not perfect, but what is?</p>
<p>Everything's Amazing and I'm Happy.</p>
