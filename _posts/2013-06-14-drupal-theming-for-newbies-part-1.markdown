<p>I've been developing themes for Drupal for about a year and a half now &amp; I can say I'm about an advanced beginner on the Dreyfus model. Drupal is such a powerful framework and everyday, I learn something new that blows my mind. Today, I'll start a series just on Drupal mainly to gain a deeper understanding of Drupal. So, let's get it started.</p>
<h3>Why Drupal?</h3>
<p>Before I continue, I have a confession... I am a WordPress-er, there I said it. At one point in time, I was a freelancer solely developing WordPress sites. But as time went on and getting a couple of more projects under my belt, I quickly learned that WordPress shouldn't be used for everything. Which is something I'm see all to often nowadays. I'm not saying if not WordPress, then Drupal. I'm just saying in some cases, another solution would make more sense. So just learn another CMS, learn how to build your own, or don't use one at all. What's the saying "<em>if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail</em>".</p>
<h3>What's Drupal?</h3>
<p>Drupal is an open source CMS  used in a variety of ways from web apps to websites, big and small. Drupal has its advantages compared to other open source CMS's. The main advantage it that it's scalable, built as a CMS platform, secure, high performance, powerful role management and extremely flexible. There are other advantages but based on my experience these are some of the main reason of why Drupal was chosen over other CMS solutions. Some pitfalls are that there are a lot of abandoned module projects, lots of unnecessary divs and the learning curve is higher than other solution.</p>
<p>Hopefully, I'll be able to help out with the learning curve. Next time of course.</p>
