The last couple of weeks have been eventful and hectic but overall, everything's good. I've been reading a lot more lately.  Mainly on reading on life and kicking ass. If your looking for a good read I'd recommend, Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less. I read it and listened to it a couple of times and I like the overall keypoints of the book. I just started a book called The 10x Rule, which is on the other end of the spectrum from Essentialism. So far the read is ok, I like the authors frankness. The books have two different approaches on getting more out of life, but the main similarity is to do things that matter the most. Other than work & reading, I've been enjoying the newly-wed life with the wife and... Well, you'll see in a couple of days.
