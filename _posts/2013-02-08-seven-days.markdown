<p>Seven days ago, I decided I was going to challenge myself by completing my personal website by (*Drumroll*) today. This was not an easy task,  with a full-time job, relationship and the many other distractions of life but, I was able to press on and complete something that I've been meaning to do for a couple of  <strong>years</strong> now. I actually started to become embarrassed when people would ask to see my work and I would have to assemble a list links of work I've done the last couple of years. So, saying that, this project was inspired by my own laziness and  me being fed up with having "<em>redesign personal website</em>" on my to-do list. I gave myself the constraint of seven days because enforcing open constraints <strong>never</strong> worked out for me. When I gave myself the deadline of, say, the end of the month, my inspiration would quickly fade away and wouldn't get done. Sigh. After reading <a href="http://www.shapeofdesignbook.com/">The Shape of Design </a>and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Steal-Like-Artist-Things-Creative/dp/0761169253">Steal Like an Artist</a>, (two books I highly recommend) one message that resonated with me was embracing constraints to fuel creativity.</p>
<p>So, I gave my self seven days. Doing this helped me look at my process and also my tendencies. For example, I get things done when going from sketch to an HTML/CSS prototype. When I open Photoshop I worry about the smallest details that are kind of irrelevant. Also, I actually enjoy not including Photoshop in my process and designing in browser. I was able to make quick decisions and experiment more rather than moving pixels around, nothings wrong with that by the way. I also realized that I'm an experimenter and that I need to experiment and try things out so I can stay interested. I think my method before was that I would out think myself to death and movement was very slow.</p>
<p>I'm super stoked about me taking on this project. Is it done you might ask, no it isn't but I think It's a very good starting point to build upon and I way better off than what I had a year, no, two years ago and I can't complain about that.</p>
