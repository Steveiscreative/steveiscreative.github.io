<p>This month, I'm working on completing one painting a week. With one week down, I was able to complete a painting and I'm proud of this accomplishment. While cleaning my brushes, I had a thought on craftsmanship. I first learned about craftsmanship in college while taking an Art 101 course. My teacher was very tough and at the time I never really saw a method to his madness as he always wanted our work to be "perfect", he rarely gave out A's (or my classmates and I never really earned an A's). As I look back, I now understand his life long lessons that he taught in his class about being an AMAZING designer, an AMAZING artist or just plain being AMAZING at what ever you decide to do. The lessons were simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Know your tools and treat them with respect,</li>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Care about the work you're doing,</span></li>
<li>Set high standards for yourself and live by them,</li>
<li>Do the work, if you know you can do better, do it again but better.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think I've unconsciously adopted the life long lessons of his class. I've just haven't taken the time out the articulate them.</p>
