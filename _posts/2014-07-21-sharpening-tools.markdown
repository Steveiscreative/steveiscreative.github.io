At the beginning of last week I did an assesment on my skills pertaining to my job/career. The skills were rated 1-5 and were based on the [dreyfus model][dreyfus]. Honestly, I was a little surprised. Many things I thought I kicked ass in; turns out I don't. Out of all of these skills, the only skills I really want to sharpen my JavaScript skills, as well as frontend application development. 

Here's a partial view:

- HTML (4)
- CSS/3 (4)
- JavaScript (3)
- Frontend Application Development (2)
- Front-end Development (4)
- PHP (3)
- MySQL (3)
- Ruby/Rails (2)


What skills are relevent to your job? Where do they fall on the dreyfus model?

I guess I've established Monday being the day I'll publish new post. Although I have to say, it's tough writing something every week.Just an fyi.
