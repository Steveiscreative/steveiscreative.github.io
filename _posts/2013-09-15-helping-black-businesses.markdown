<p>"Where are the African-American businesses?" This is something I've been hearing a lot lately and it' quite bothersome. Maybe, due to my circle of friends or the businesses I've helped in the past, I can't bring myself to ask this question. I see them all around. But this has me asking, why is everyone asking this? As I sit here and think, I don't think the issue is the lack of African-American business, the think the <em>real</em> issue is the lack of awareness and in turn, lack of support. So, like many thinking men, I started to ponder how do you increase awareness and can the web be used to increase awareness?</p>
<p>After thinking, sketching and prototyping this week, I was able to solidify some ideas I've had and more importantly solutions to increasing awareness over the web. The general concept of the solution I came up with is an interactive business directory for African-American Businesses. The application will highlight businesses relevant to the user based on their location. I think increasing awareness through the web is a valid solution to this problem and if it's not, then back to the drawing board.</p>
<p>The name is still up in the air but for now, the name is Our Businesses.</p>
