<p>Yesterday I came up with an idea to write a book. On what? No idea. But I'll come up with a topic and update you in the near future. I'm not writing a book because I'm an expert or anything.But I think it will be an excellent challenge where I'll learn some new things and refine some of the old things I know. I'll keep everything posted on here and I'll use <a href="https://leanpub.com/">https://leanpub.com/</a> as the publishing platform.</p>
