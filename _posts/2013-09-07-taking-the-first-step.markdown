<p>This week, I started a new personal project of mine and... I already feel a<em> little</em> overwhelmed. Maybe it's the mixture of being extremely busy at work, or, my the need of having a personal life after work, or, overall… being afraid of the unknown when starting a new project. I admit, I'm always little intimidated starting something new and this has stopped me in the past from pursuing certain ideas. It's kind of sad, and I'm actually fed up with myself. I'll stop dwelling and leave the past where it is, time to turn over a new leaf.</p>
<p>Before, I get deep into this project, I wanted to start by doing something completely different. I wanted to announce that I'm pursing a new project and use the power of the web  to help me take the first step (and many more). Another thing I'm doing differently is posting weekly updates to share my progress and process.</p>
