<p>This weekend, I was able to read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1477800670/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1477800670&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=stevestephcre-20"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Manage Your Day-to-Day: Build your Routine, Find your focus &amp; Sharpen your creative mind</span></a>. This was actually my second time reading, first the digital version when it first released, then the physical version this weekend. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who designs, writes or creates for a living, there is a lot of insightful information in there that anyone could use.</p>
<p>The sections of the book that I paid the most attention to were the ones that addressed our continuous connectivity, information overdose, and our constant use of technology. When I think of the different outcomes these have on society it kind of scares the living hell out of me. What's scarier is that some of the negative outcomes have become social norms. Norms such as; living through screens and not in the moment; a deterioration in manners (for example, conversations where people are looking on their phones/computers rather being engaged in the conversation); procrastination; instant gratification that induces a "now mentality"; low attention span; poor memory;  and the most damaging the mass spread of stupidity (a spread of wrong information, racism, negativity, twerking, bad ideas... things like that). I'm not saying that these are the only outcomes, the juxtaposition of these happen as well.</p>
<p>Wow! I've really digressed from my original idea. Well, with all this thinking I want to try an experiment. The experiment is see the effects, if any, of limiting my connectivity in such an interconnected world. This includes limiting my accessibility via Text, iMessage, etc.; detaching myself from my phone &amp; computer; and limiting the amount of information I allow in my life (no social media, only checking my email twice a day, cut feeds on my Readkit). Originally, I was going to do this for a week, but after more thinking I've decided to do this for the remainder of the month.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago I lived without a year without a cell phone and it was, well, excellent and very easy for me to do. I think this time it'll be a little difficult for me to do, over the years I've grown attached to certain things. Wish me luck.</p>
