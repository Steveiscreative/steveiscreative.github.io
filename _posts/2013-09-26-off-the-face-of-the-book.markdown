<p>I know...corny, but you get the point. I've cancelled my Facebook account.</p>
<p>For the last couple of years I've been complaining how much I hate Facebook and how Facebook is satan's spawn. So, I've decided to display the ultimate form of hate by canceling Facebook account. My hate isn't out of jealousy or anything. I just can't support their constant changes, their lack of respect for users data &amp; security, their ethics (haha...ethics?), and honestly, the people. The people are my own doing,  I <del>have</del> had about 2000+ friends and most of the stuff on my feed was near pointless.</p>
<p>My overall goal by the end of the year is to dramatically reduce the amount of information I receive in my life. Also, to be extremely critical about the information I allow into my life. I firmly believe as a society we're overdosing on information and I leave it up to you to decide if the information your receiving on a daily basis is good or bad. Personally, I believe that social media is a major culprit of people overdosing on extremely pointless (bad) information. But, that's just me. Next on my list, is restarting my twitter (I actually like twitter) &amp; getting rid of my Instagram. I'm taking baby steps.</p>
