<p>After a couple of months now of going back and forth in my head. I've decided to drop WordPress for an alternative blogging solution. Don't get me wrong, WordPress is amazing. But right now, I'm just bored with it and it just doesn't fit my ideal workflow or how I currently operate. Also, I don't like how WordPress has become the endÂ all, be all for most web site/solutions even if it doesn't make sense. What can I say, I'm a hater. So far, I have a couple of alternatives in mind mainly Jekyll or Octopress. It's appealing to me that I can write a blog post, and deploy with out even leaving iTerm/Vim. For the next couple of weeks I'll be testing out different frameworks, CMS's &amp; blogging platforms to see which is right for me.</p>
