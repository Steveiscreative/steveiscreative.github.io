If you have not watched the DevTools State of the Union, I would recommend watching it. Also if you have the time, I would check out the rest of the conference videos as well. If not, I would at least watch [Architecting resilient front-ends][architecting] by Andy Hume. That video had some good takeaways as well.

For me, the most important takeaway was the 2015 Web Performance Model. I think as an industry we’re finally realizing the importance of performance. Also, how performance is part of the user experience. In all, the web performance model gave me a general baseline of the ideal performance times for a website/application in 2015.

Another takeaway was the importance of knowing what’s under the hood when using libraries. In the Wikipedia example, the issues seemed to stem from not knowing the inner workings of jQuery's methods. Ultimately this lack of understanding caused some of their performance woes. I think all developers are guilty of this, including myself. This year I have made the effort to read through the source code of the libraries I use. I think you have to start doing this to make informed decisions in your code. You also learn more about the language when you go through good libraries. For example, Lo-dash, jQuery and Angular to name a few.

The final takeaway is more of a reminder to myself of the importance of tooling in todays day in time. The point of tooling is to make life easier for developers. If you're not utilizing any tools, you should start...TODAY! If you think there's an easier way to do something, there probably is. Find out your pain points and see if there are any tools to help. Development is getting complex and the time allotted for development is being cut in half. So, do yourself a favor and start using some tools to make live easier.
