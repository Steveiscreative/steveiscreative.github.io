As a developer, one of the most vital tools in your toolbox is a personal code snippet library. Having one is an amazing thing and I'd strongly suggest that you start one. Don't think you need one? Here's a rule of thumb, if you keep visiting your past projects to lift some code you wrote for it... you probably need a lib(rary) brah. The main benefit is that you'll save time and energy in the long run because you'll have vital code in a consolidated application/folder. Also, as you grow and become a smarter developer, your code grows as well ([check this guy out][jsoneliners]). So, for the last time, start a library.

For the last two odd years I've been using CodeBox. It's a pretty good code manager, I have yet to have a technical issue with it. But I ran into one dilemma; small, but it kind had me question the way I manage my snippets. The dilemma was sharing code with others (sharing is caring right?), for me to do this I had to copy the solution to three different files, zip it up and email it out. At the time, I felt like to many steps and I felt that there was an easier way to do this. With where the web and the industry is headed, the answer to my question was quite obvious; I'll use an open source platform manage my code.categorize

The platform I've decided to go with is [Gist][gist] along with [Gistbox][gistbox]. The main reason is because I’m familiar with it, its version controlled and tasks like sharing can be done with a click of a button. Also, GistBox extends the capabilities of Gist allowing me to categorize snippets (Big plus). Another benefit is that I'll be able to access my code from any computer (Hells yeah!). Finally, I’ll be able to benefit from other people’s code by adding it my library and updating it to meet my needs.

So for the next couple of weeks stand by as I slowly but surely add my library to my [Gist][gist].
