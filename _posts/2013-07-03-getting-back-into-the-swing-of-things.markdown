<p>This month, I'm dedicating some of my time to really master the advanced concepts of JavaScript and dropping jQuery. I think it has been a long time coming. I've had a love/hate thing going on with jQuery and the "there's a plugin for that" mentality is kind of, well...not fun. Don't get me wrong, jQuery is amazing but I would like to do things<a href="http://vimeo.com/59384516"> the long hard stupid way</a> for a while.</p>
