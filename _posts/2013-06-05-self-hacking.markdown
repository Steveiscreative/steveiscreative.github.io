<p>For the last month or so I've been conducting experiments on myself to well answer some pretty awesome questions that I've been collecting in my mind. Can you make yourself smarter? Could you make your self smarter in month? A week? Could you rapidly gain muscle mass in a short period of time? Can I become more efficient, do more and feel like I'm not burning the candle at both ends?  Could you get less sleep and it be sufficient for a full 12 hour day? Could I read full books in matter of hours (1-2) and comprehend it? Well, could you?</p>
<p>Like any human living in this century I did a google search and I was surprised that the answer to most these questions was yes. Acquiring most of these only require three things; time, commitment, and repetition. Most of the "hacks" feed off of your body's wiring and use it to get the results you would like to achieve.</p>
<p>With a month of "hacking myself", I can tell you I've been able to learn things more quickly, lost some bad fat and gain lean muscle and I just feel mentally quicker. I've tried things ranging from cold showers in the morning for a week, working on acquiring habits, to trying some <a href="http://www.bulletproofexec.com/how-to-make-your-coffee-bulletproof-and-your-morning-too/">Bulletproof coffee </a>and <a href="https://www.onnit.com/alphabrain/">Alpha Brain</a>. After a month I'm really amped to see how far I can push my own limits, mentally, physically and spiritually.</p>
