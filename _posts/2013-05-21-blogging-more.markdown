<p>I hate writing. I absolutely, completely, 100 percent-ly HATE writing. But I can ignore the fact that writing is a necessary skill to being an amazing designer/developer. I've kind of put "Blog More" on the back burner of my New Year goals. Which is actually not normal this year because I have been able to accomplish many items on my goals list. I think I've put writing on the back burner because of fear. So to get over this fear of writing and putting it out for the world to see, I've to publish something every Tuesday and Thursday.</p>
<p>Wish me luck.</p>
