<p>When it comes to innovation there are two-way to go about; additive innovation &amp; subtractive innovation. Additive innovation is when things, tools, methodology, processes and the like are added to what already exist inside your organization or company. Sometimes added without question. Additive innovation ask, "what can we add to our organization, team, culture, or process that can make us innovative". The flaw in this way of thinking is it tends to add useless bits and pieces that no real value. Unfortunately, this is the most common approach when companies look to innovate.</p>
<p>The other type of innovation is innovation through subtraction. This is when a company ask "what can we take away to make us more innovation" or "what destroys innovation and do less of that". This is where the really magic happens. Â But unfortunately, this is more difficult because this is actually a skill to be nurtured.</p>
