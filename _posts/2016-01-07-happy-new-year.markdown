Happy New Year!
I hope everyone is having a good new year so far. This year I have a couple of goals... I'm refusing to say resolutions because they never stick.
And unlike my past resolutions I've created actual plans to accomplish the goals I've set. One thing that's planned for this year is write on a consistent basis.
In fact, I've started to write every single day a journal, which has actually helped me get comfortable with writing again.

To keep it simple I'll post something every Thursday. If I get comfortable with that, I'll add an extra day. For the first half of the year I'll be exploring different aspects of JavaScript.
Mainly different frameworks, advanced concepts and things pertaining to frontend application development. For the second half, I'll be switching things up and going over modern PHP development. 
Personally I've felt a little behind on the modern PHP development so I think it's about time I sit down and look into that. Also, I may hop on the soapbox a couple of times this year, so my apologies in advance.

Cheers and I hope everybody has a prosperous New Year!
