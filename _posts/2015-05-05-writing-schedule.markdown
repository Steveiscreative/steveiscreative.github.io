Keeping a consistent writing schedule is pretty difficult. Especially if you're super busy at work, planning a wedding or attempting to have a personal life.

But for the rest of the year I'll be making a commitment to publishing posting at least twice a week; Tuesdays and Thursdays.

So, just stay tuned :)
