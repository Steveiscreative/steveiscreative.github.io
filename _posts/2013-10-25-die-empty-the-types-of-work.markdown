<p>I'm currently reading "<a href="http://amzn.to/1amWZz6">Die Empty</a>", and it's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_05qJTeNNI">pretty pretty pretty good</a>. To internalize the messages and principles of the book I've decided to blog about them. So, here I go.</p>
<p>There are three types of work; Mapping, which is  planning; Making, which is doing; &amp; Meshing which is learning.</p>
<p>When it comes to the types of work we tend to do some more than the other. Depending on the combination,  this results to certain types of people.</p>
<p>When a person is good at all three types of work then they are considered developers. The developer basically get's shit done with the resources &amp; opportunities s/he has to create value.</p>
<p>When a person is a good at making and meshing, they are considered drifters. Drifters aren't able to complete big task because they tend to get sidetracked or distracted due to their inability to planning.</p>
<p>When a person is good at making and mapping, they are consider drivers.Drivers get a lot of work done but does little to increase his skills for future success.</p>
<p>When a person is good at mapping and meshing, they are Dreamers, the plan and learn but no action is performed.</p>
<p>To be candid, I would consider myself a drifter. I like learning and I tend to hop from project to project solely to learn something new. I'm aiming to be a developer! I have faith in me!</p>
