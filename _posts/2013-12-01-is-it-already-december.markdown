<p>Happy Holidays Everybody! Wow it's already December!</p>
<p>One of my goals this year was to learn a new programming language/framework (Ruby/Rails) and to master one I already know. I was able to complete the latter by getting really intimate with JavaScript but I haven't really digged into a new language until... a week ago. Sigh, what can I say I've been <del>lazy</del> <strong>busy</strong>. It's been a good week of learning and after buckling down and going through the <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html">Rails walk-through</a>, I feel confident to venture off and complete a side project to learn some more. Surprisingly, the hardest part of was setting up the environment, a good resource is http://railsapps.github.io/installrubyonrails-mac.html, but I still have some lingering questions.</p>
<p>Besides my Ruby on Rails adventure this month, I really want to get in the habit of writing more. So to mimic one of my favorite blog-december-only resources, <a href="http://24ways.org/">24ways</a> (check out the redesign), I'm going to blog everyday up til Xmas. Not on design or development specifically, really on anything my heart desires, I just want to get in the habit of writing more, which is one of my goals for next year.</p>
