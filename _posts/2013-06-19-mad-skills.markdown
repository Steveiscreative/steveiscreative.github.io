<p>For the last couple of days, I've been gathering some information on the skills necessary to become a senior level interactive developer. I've decided that is my current goal, career wise that I'm trying to achieve. After churning through a couple of jobs sites and looking at my current jobs requirements, I ran into some common skills necessary for fulfill the tasked. Besides experience, these are the skills necessary:</p>
<ol>
<li>Excellent communication  &amp; verbal skills</li>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS2.1, CSS 3, CSS Preprocessors</li>
<li>JavaScript
<ol>
<li>OOP</li>
<li>Frameworks (jQuery)</li>
<li>Ajax</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>A Server-side technology
<ol>
<li>PHP</li>
<li>Ruby *In demand currently, many web apps are switching to ruby, rails or Sinatra being the frameworks of choice *</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Database knowledge</li>
<li>UI Design
<ol>
<li>Desktop</li>
<li>Mobile</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Web Standards</li>
<li>508 Compliance</li>
<li>Version control knowledge, GIT in particular</li>
<li>CMS
<ol>
<li>Drupal</li>
<li>WordPress</li>
<li>ExpressionEngine</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Knowledge of browser capabilities/limitation</li>
</ol>
<p>So you would think that this would be something that would take a couple of years but I want to really master many of these by the end of this year. Is it possible? Absolutely! I'm already proficient and some of these skills and but there is some that I really need to put in extra effort. You can't suck at something forever, can you? Can you? Of course I won't be doing all on the list. I will have to sit down and figure out which skills are relevant.</p>
<p>Before I venture off to learn these skills I really want to work on becoming an <b>effective/faster learner, a speed reader </b>and<b> a better typist</b>. I feel that these skills will accelerate my learning capabilities tenfold. First on the list is reading the book <i>The First 20 Hours,</i> which is about rapid skill acquisition.</p>
<p>Overall, I feel I am headed in the right direction career wise.</p>
