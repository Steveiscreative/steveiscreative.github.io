title:  "Server Migration Complete!"

A couple of months, I had decided to move from my hosting provider of 8 years, and create a more cost-effective option for managing/hosting my websites. I moved my personal site on github pages and decided to use [Pantheon][pantheon] for hosting client sites. I found that using Pantheon may be more costly than other hosting services, like GoDaddy, but it's worth it in due the security measures in place and I don't have to spend time managing a server. I also use [Digital Ocean][digital_ocean] for my various experiments or to just f*ck around with a server every now and then. 

The final step, which was completed moments ago, was finding an email hosting solution and setting up my @stevenstephenson.com email addresses. I like to separate my personal stuff and business. If you're in the same boat, and your looking for something free, I'd suggest [Zoho mail][zoho_mail]. It wasn't unbarable to setup and if you use any other Zoho products it'll fit in well with your current system.

Anyhow, I've completed my migration and I'm not spending a forunte hosting and managing sites. Yaaay!
