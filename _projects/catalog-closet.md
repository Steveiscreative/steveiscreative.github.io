Catalog Closet is a small startup with the goal of providing extra closet space to city dwellers. Catalog Closet will pick up and store customer's clothes. From there the customer can request their clothes on-demand through the "Virtual Closet" application.

I was responsible for designing and developing the "Virtual Closet" application and the marketing website. This project involved continuous collaboration with the Catalog Closet team. Together we fleshed out the customer experience from initial pickup to delivery and created an application that fits internally and for their customers.
