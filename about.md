<p class="lead">I'm a full-stack web developer living in Baltimore, Maryland.</p>

I'm currently an Assoicate Director of (Web) Development at [idfive](http://idfive.com) leading a team and developing accessible and visually appealing websites and web applications. 

When I'm not working or thinking about websites, I like to spend time with my wife and daughters. I'm also a professional binge watcher.
