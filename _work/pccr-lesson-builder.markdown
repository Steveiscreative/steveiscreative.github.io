For this project, I was the full-stack developer in charge of implementing the application. After talking to the PM and creative director, I decided that the best approach for implementing this tool was to develop a single page application. Due to thier current architecture we used a 'Headless Drupal' architecture, which had it's pain points. I worked on various task such as setting up the endpoints, desktop and mobile front-end development and Angular Development. Also, after the initial launch, we turned this application into an iOS app. Overall, a very fun and fast paced project that I'm extremely proud of.
