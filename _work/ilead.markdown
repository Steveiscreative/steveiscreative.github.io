As a startup company, Innovative Leadership Strategies wanted to create a brand stands out from their local competitors and represented their company.

After assisting Innovative Leadership Strategies crafting their vision for their company,
I developed a young, hip and professional brand for the company. I also crafted their tag line of "Great leaders think differently. We teach them how". After crafting their brand we created various marketing materials such as a website,
business cards, handbills and brochures.
